- **Webhook Listeners**: Receive instant updates when dependencies are created or modified
- **Bulk Import**: Quickly import thousands of dependencies from your existing Jira and Jira Align instances
- **Cross-ART Visibility**: Automatically detect dependencies that cross Agile Release Train boundaries

## üß™ The Science Behind It

DependencyForecaster is built on cutting-edge scientific principles:

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
PINNs incorporate physical laws into neural networks, ensuring predictions adhere to scientific principles. In our application, we model dependencies as complex systems with:
- Conservation laws for resource allocation
- Risk propagation dynamics
- Team interaction physics

### Universal Differential Equations (UDEs)
UDEs combine differential equations with neural networks for hybrid modeling that captures:
- Known dynamics from project management science
- Unknown dynamics learned from your organization's data
- Scale-invariant properties that work for teams of any size

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Causal Inference**: Detect true dependency relationships vs. correlation
- **Graph Theory**: Identify critical paths and dependency patterns
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Track and forecast dependency resolution trends

## üíª Technical Architecture

DependencyForecaster is built on a modern, scalable stack designed for seamless Atlassian integration:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Shadcn UI components for beautiful visualizations
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express optimized for Atlassian Connect integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for multi-tenant data storage
- **Scientific Computing**: Julia integration for advanced mathematical modeling
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for live collaboration and updates
- **Atlassian Authentication**: JWT-based Atlassian Connect authentication
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Full isolation between customer instances
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time event processing from Jira and Jira Align
- **iFrame Embedding**: Seamless integration within the Atlassian product experience
