### Optimization Engine
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get intelligent suggestions to resolve dependency conflicts
- **Scenario Analysis**: Run "what-if" scenarios to optimize dependency networks
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast potential risks before they impact your program

## üß™ The Science Behind It

JIRA-AI Dependency Tracker is built on cutting-edge scientific principles:

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
PINNs incorporate physical laws into neural networks, ensuring predictions adhere to scientific principles. In our application, we model dependencies as complex systems with:
- Conservation laws for resource allocation
- Risk propagation dynamics
- Team interaction physics

### Universal Differential Equations (UDEs)
UDEs combine differential equations with neural networks for hybrid modeling that captures:
- Known dynamics from project management science
- Unknown dynamics learned from your organization's data
- Scale-invariant properties that work for teams of any size

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Causal Inference**: Detect true dependency relationships vs. correlation
- **Graph Theory**: Identify critical paths and dependency patterns
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Track and forecast dependency resolution trends

## üíª Technical Architecture

JIRA-AI Dependency Tracker is built on a modern, scalable stack:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Scientific Computing**: Julia integration for advanced mathematical modeling
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for live updates
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT implementation with role-based access control
